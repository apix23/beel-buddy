In order to get the stylings:

Text elements:

For p, h1, h2 and h3 elements no class is needed.

Base text styling can be given to a certain element by adding the class "base-text".

For small prints, the class "small-text" is needed.


Input and textareas:

For inputs and textareas, no class is needed.

Use the regular syntax for labels and inputs/textareas:
<label for="age">Age: </label> 
<input type="text" name="age" required>


Buttons:

For big buttons, the class "big-button" is needed.

For small buttons, the class "small-button" is needed.
